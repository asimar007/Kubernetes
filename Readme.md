# Kubernetes

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. Originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container orchestration.

## Key Features

- **Automated Deployment and Scaling:** Kubernetes manages the deployment and scaling of containerized applications, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization.
- **Self-Healing:** Automatically replaces and reschedules containers from failed nodes, restarts containers that fail, and kills containers that don't respond to user-defined health checks.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Exposes containers using DNS names or IP addresses and balances network traffic to ensure stable deployments.
- **Storage Orchestration:** Automatically mounts the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, public cloud providers, or network storage systems.
- **Secret and Configuration Management:** Manages sensitive information and configuration separately from application code.

## Core Concepts

- **Pod:** The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process in your cluster.
- **Node:** A worker machine (physical or virtual) where Kubernetes runs your workloads.
- **Cluster:** A set of nodes managed by the Kubernetes control plane.
- **Deployment:** Manages the creation and updates of Pods.
- **Service:** An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

## Why Use Kubernetes?

- **Portability:** Works with any container runtime and infrastructure, including on-premises, public cloud, or hybrid environments.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications up or down based on demand.
- **Resilience:** Ensures your applications remain available and recover quickly from failures.
- **Ecosystem:** Supported by a large and active open-source community, with a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions.
